Assuming I can adjust the extention, or even and possible more appropriately, the location of this file to avoid any actual input
coming from it and so I can forgo using an exemption command (name?) such as '//'. This rings doubly true as that input (key? im learning)
is likely only even pertinent for certain syntaxes. Anyway, we've branched out and this is our first real edit to a commit that we are
keeping seperate from the master. Sword.
